# VSVTrend: Adaptive Trading Strategy for TradingView with Advanced Risk Management

## Project Overview

VSVTrend is an advanced trading strategy developed for TradingView using Pine Script, designed to enhance trading decision-making through intelligent, adaptive indicators and robust risk management.

### Core Purpose
The project aims to create a sophisticated, open-source trading strategy that provides traders with a reliable and flexible tool for market analysis across various financial instruments and timeframes. By incorporating adaptive indicators and advanced filtering mechanisms, VSVTrend seeks to minimize false signals and optimize trade entry and exit points.

### Key Features
- **Adaptive Strategy Management**: Toggle strategy on/off with a single button
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Optional Supertrend filter to validate trade signals
- **Dynamic Risk Management**: 
  - Configurable stop-loss and take-profit percentages
  - Automatic position sizing based on account equity
- **Versatility**: Compatible with multiple timeframes and asset classes
- **Transparent Development**: Open-source strategy inviting community collaboration and continuous improvement

## Dataset

The VSVTrend strategy utilizes trading data for its analysis and strategy development. While the project does not include a comprehensive external dataset, it provides a sample trade log for reference and potential model training purposes.

### Sample Trade Log
- **File**: `sample_tradelog.csv`
- **Purpose**: Provides example trade data for initial model training and strategy development
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Contains trading performance records
  - Used as a reference for machine learning model training
  - Helps in understanding strategy performance and signal characteristics

#### Data Considerations
- The strategy is designed to be adaptive and work across multiple financial instruments and timeframes
- No fixed dataset is required; the strategy can be applied to various market data
- Supports backtesting functionality for comprehensive performance analysis

### Data Requirements
- Compatible with TradingView charting platform
- Works with multiple financial instruments (stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex)
- Supports all timeframes
- Requires historical price data for strategy implementation

## Model Architecture and Training

The VSVTrend strategy is a trading strategy implemented in Pine Script, designed for financial market analysis and automated trading. It leverages technical analysis indicators, specifically the Supertrend indicator, to generate trading signals.

### Model Components

The strategy incorporates the following key components:
- Supertrend Indicator: Uses Average True Range (ATR) to determine market trend and potential entry/exit points
- Configurable Parameters:
  - ATR Period: Determines the sensitivity of the trend calculation (default: 10)
  - Factor: Multiplier used in Supertrend calculation (default: 3.0)
  - Stop Loss: Maximum acceptable loss percentage (default: 1.5%)
  - Take Profit: Target profit percentage (default: 3.0%)

### Trading Logic

The strategy operates with the following core trading mechanisms:
- Long Entry Condition: Triggered when the Supertrend indicator shifts to a bullish (green) state
- Short Entry Condition: Activated when the Supertrend indicator changes to a bearish (red) state
- Risk Management: Implements predefined stop loss and take profit percentages to control potential losses and secure gains

### Strategy Configuration

Traders can customize the strategy using built-in input parameters:
- `show_strategy`: Enable/disable the entire trading strategy
- `use_supertrend`: Toggle Supertrend filter on/off
- `atrPeriod`: Adjust the period for Average True Range calculation
- `factor`: Modify the Supertrend sensitivity
- `sl`: Set stop loss percentage
- `tp`: Define take profit percentage

### Training and Optimization

This is a rule-based strategy that does not involve traditional machine learning training. Instead, optimization occurs through parameter tuning and backtesting on historical market data within trading platforms that support Pine Script.

## Evaluation and Results

The VSVTrend strategy is designed for trading performance evaluation, focusing on several key aspects of strategy effectiveness.

### Evaluation Methodology
The strategy employs multiple performance metrics and evaluation techniques:

- **Backtesting Framework**: Integrated directly within the TradingView Pine Script environment
- **Performance Parameters**:
  - Strategy Toggle: Ability to turn the strategy on/off
  - Supertrend Filter: Optional filtering mechanism to refine trade signals
  - Risk Management:
    - Stop Loss: Configurable at 1.5% of equity
    - Take Profit: Configurable at 3.0% of equity
  - Position Sizing: 10% of account equity per trade

### Key Metrics
- Entry Conditions:
  - Long Entry: Supertrend direction is positive (1)
  - Short Entry: Supertrend direction is negative (-1)
- Risk Control:
  - Dynamic Stop Loss percentage
  - Dynamic Take Profit percentage
- Technical Indicators:
  - Average True Range (ATR) with a 10-period lookback
  - Supertrend indicator with configurable factor (default: 3.0)

### Evaluation Considerations
- Supports multiple timeframes
- Adaptable parameters for different market conditions
- Built-in false signal detection mechanism
- Flexible strategy activation

#### Recommended Evaluation Process
1. Enable/disable strategy using `show_strategy` input
2. Toggle Supertrend filter using `use_supertrend` input
3. Adjust ATR period and Supertrend factor
4. Conduct comprehensive backtesting across various market conditions

## Inference / How to Use the Model

The VSVTrend strategy is a Pine Script designed for TradingView, providing a sophisticated trading strategy with adaptive indicators and filters.

### Inference Requirements
