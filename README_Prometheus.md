  - On/off toggle for the entire strategy
  - Optional Supertrend filter
  - Configurable ATR (Average True Range) period and factor
- **Risk Management**:
  - Customizable Stop Loss (SL) percentage
  - Customizable Take Profit (TP) percentage
  - Percentage-based equity allocation
- **Versatility**: Compatible with multiple timeframes and financial instruments

### Unique Advantages
- Open-source approach allowing community-driven improvements
- Designed to be a foundational "alpha indicator" for traders
- Combines technical analysis with potential for AI/ML enhancement

## Getting Started, Installation, and Setup

### Prerequisites
- TradingView Pro or Pro+ account (required for custom strategies)
- Basic understanding of Pine Script and trading strategies

### Installation
1. Open TradingView and navigate to the Pine Editor
2. Create a new script or open an existing strategy
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `VSVTrend.pine` into the editor

### Configuration Options
The strategy provides several configurable inputs to customize its behavior:

- `Strategy ON/OFF`: Toggle the entire strategy on or off
- `Supertrend filter`: Enable or disable the Supertrend filter
- `ATR period`: Adjust the Average True Range period (default: 10)
- `Factor`: Modify the Supertrend sensitivity (default: 3.0)
- `Stop Loss`: Set the stop loss percentage (default: 1.5%)
- `Take Profit`: Set the take profit percentage (default: 3.0%)

### Quick Start
1. In TradingView, go to the Pine Editor
2. Paste the `VSVTrend.pine` script
3. Apply the strategy to your desired chart
4. Adjust input parameters as needed
5. Enable/disable the strategy using the visual toggle

### Compatibility
- Compatible with all TradingView chart timeframes
- Supports both long and short trading positions
- Designed for equity trading with default 10% position sizing

## Dataset

The VSVTrend strategy utilizes financial market data for trading strategy development and backtesting. 

### Data Source
The strategy is designed to work with TradingView's financial market price data across multiple timeframes. It does not rely on a fixed external dataset but rather uses real-time or historical price data from trading platforms.

### Data Characteristics
- **Types of Data**: Financial price data (Open, High, Low, Close prices)
- **Supported Timeframes**: All TradingView chart timeframes
- **Key Indicators Used**:
  - Supertrend indicator
  - ATR (Average True Range)

### Sample Data
A sample trade log is included in the repository to demonstrate potential model training data. The file `sample_tradelog.csv` provides insights into trade logging and potential machine learning model training.

### Data Processing
The strategy employs several key data processing techniques:
- Dynamic ATR calculation (period configurable)
- Supertrend filter with adjustable factor
- Percentage-based Stop Loss and Take Profit mechanisms

## Model Architecture and Training

The project implements a trading strategy using TradingView's Pine Script language, focusing on trend-following methodology with Supertrend indicator and configurable risk management.

#### Model Architecture
The strategy is built around the Supertrend technical indicator, which is a trend-following algorithm that helps identify market trends and potential entry/exit points. Key components include:

- Supertrend Indicator
  - Calculates trend direction using Average True Range (ATR)
  - Configurable ATR period (default: 10)
  - Configurable factor for trend sensitivity (default: 3.0)

#### Strategy Parameters
- Strategy Toggle: Enable/disable the entire trading strategy
- Supertrend Filter: Option to apply Supertrend trend filter
- Risk Management
  - Stop Loss: Configurable percentage (default: 1.5%)
  - Take Profit: Configurable percentage (default: 3.0%)

#### Trading Logic
- Long Entry Condition: When Supertrend indicates an upward trend
- Short Entry Condition: When Supertrend indicates a downward trend
- Position Sizing: Percent of equity (default: 10%)

#### Training and Optimization
This is a rule-based strategy implemented in Pine Script, which does not involve traditional machine learning training. Instead, optimization occurs through parameter tuning:
- Adjust ATR period to match market characteristics
- Modify factor to control trend sensitivity
- Fine-tune stop loss and take profit percentages

Traders can customize parameters directly in the TradingView Pine Script editor to adapt the strategy to different financial instruments and market conditions.

## Inference / How to Use the Model

The VSVTrend strategy is a trading strategy script designed for TradingView, providing automated entry and exit signals based on the Supertrend indicator.

### Configuration Options

Users can customize the strategy through several input parameters:

- `show_strategy`: A boolean toggle to turn the strategy on or off (default: `true`)
- `use_supertrend`: A boolean to enable/disable the Supertrend filter (default: `true`)
- `atrPeriod`: The period for Average True Range (ATR) calculation (default: `10`)
- `factor`: The multiplier used in Supertrend calculation (default: `3.0`)
- `sl`: Stop Loss percentage (default: `1.5%`)
- `tp`: Take Profit percentage (default: `3.0%`)

### Trading Signals

The strategy generates the following signals:
- Long Entry: When the Supertrend direction is positive (green)
- Short Entry: When the Supertrend direction is negative (red)

### How to Use

1. Open TradingView Pine Editor
2. Create a new strategy script
3. Copy and paste the entire `VSVTrend.pine` script
4. Apply the script to a chart
5. Adjust input parameters as desired

#### Example Customization

```pine
// Disable Supertrend filter
use_supertrend = false

// Adjust ATR period and factor
atrPeriod = 14
factor = 2.5

// Set custom Stop Loss and Take Profit
sl = 2.0 / 100  // 2% Stop Loss
tp = 4.0 / 100  // 4% Take Profit
```

### Considerations

- The strategy is designed for educational and research purposes
- Always backtest and validate the strategy before real-world trading
- Performance may vary across different markets and timeframes
