## Dataset

The VSVTrend strategy operates directly on financial market price data and does not require a separate external dataset. The strategy is designed to work with price data from TradingView across various financial instruments and timeframes.

### Data Characteristics
- **Source**: Real-time or historical financial market price data
- **Compatibility**: Works with any financial instrument available on TradingView
- **Timeframes**: Supports all timeframe configurations

### Key Data Parameters
- Uses technical indicators including:
  - Supertrend indicator
  - Average True Range (ATR) with a configurable period (default: 10)
- Calculates trading signals based on price action and trend direction

### Data Requirements
- Requires price data with the following minimum fields:
  - Open price
  - Close price
  - High price
  - Low price

## Model Architecture and Training

The VSVTrend strategy employs a sophisticated trading approach combining technical analysis indicators with adaptive risk management.

### Model Architecture

The strategy is implemented as a Pine Script trading algorithm with several key components:
- **Supertrend Indicator**: Uses Average True Range (ATR) to dynamically calculate trend direction
  - Configurable ATR period (default: 10)
  - Configurable factor for trend sensitivity (default: 3.0)
- **Adaptive Risk Management**:
  - Dynamic Stop Loss: Configurable percentage (default: 1.5%)
  - Dynamic Take Profit: Configurable percentage (default: 3.0%)

### Training Approach

The strategy is designed for discretionary trading and backtesting on TradingView, with the following training characteristics:
- Configurable strategy toggle to enable/disable trading logic
- Optional Supertrend filter for trend confirmation
- Works across multiple timeframes
- Supports both long and short trading conditions

### Training Parameters

Key configurable parameters include:
- `show_strategy`: Boolean to enable/disable the entire strategy
- `use_supertrend`: Boolean to enable/disable Supertrend filter
- `atrPeriod`: Integer defining the ATR calculation period (default: 10)
- `factor`: Float defining Supertrend sensitivity (default: 3.0)
- `sl`: Stop Loss percentage (default: 1.5%)
- `tp`: Take Profit percentage (default: 3.0%)

### Trading Logic

The strategy generates trading signals based on:
1. Supertrend direction (green for long, red for short)
2. Strategy visibility toggle
3. Entry conditions for long and short positions
4. Adaptive Take Profit and Stop Loss management

### Limitations and Considerations

- Requires manual configuration and testing on specific trading instruments
- Performance may vary across different market conditions
- Recommended to extensively backtest before live trading

## Evaluation and Results

The VSVTrend strategy employs multiple evaluation techniques to ensure robust trading performance:

### Performance Metrics
The strategy is evaluated using the following key metrics:
- Entry Conditions: Driven by Supertrend indicator direction
- Risk Management: 
  - Stop Loss: Configurable, default set to 1.5% of equity
  - Take Profit: Configurable, default set to 3.0% of equity
- Position Sizing: Percentage-based equity allocation (default 10%)

### Evaluation Methodology
The strategy utilizes multiple filters and conditions for trade entry and exit:
- Supertrend Indicator: Primary trend filter (can be toggled on/off)
- Strategy Toggle: Ability to enable/disable the entire strategy
- ATR-based Supertrend Calculation:
  - ATR Period: Configurable (default 10)
  - Supertrend Factor: Configurable (default 3.0)

### Backtesting Considerations
- Works across multiple timeframes
- Supports visual on/off toggle for strategy visualization
- Designed for comprehensive performance analysis

### Limitations and Considerations
- Performance may vary across different market conditions
- User is responsible for fine-tuning parameters
- Recommended to conduct thorough testing before live trading
