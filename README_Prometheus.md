## Dataset

Dataset details are specific to trading data used in the strategy. The dataset appears to be a trade log for model training, with the following characteristics:

### Data Source
A sample trade log is provided at `data/sample_tradelog.csv`. However, this file is not currently present in the repository.

### Data Characteristics
- The strategy works with trading data across all timeframes
- Uses TradingView price data as its primary input source
- Utilizes financial market price and trend information
- Key metrics include:
  - Price data
  - Supertrend indicator values
  - ATR (Average True Range) period
  - Entry and exit conditions

### Key Data Parameters
- ATR Period: Configurable, default is 10
- Supertrend Factor: Configurable, default is 3.0
- Stop Loss: Configurable, default is 1.5%
- Take Profit: Configurable, default is 3.0%

### Preprocessing and Filtering
- Built-in AI/ML module for identifying potential false trading signals
- Adaptive strategy that can toggle Supertrend filter on/off
- Supports percentage-based equity risk management

*Note: Detailed dataset documentation may require additional files or configuration not currently present in the repository.*

## Model Architecture and Training

The VSVTrend strategy is implemented as a Pine Script trading strategy for TradingView, leveraging several key technical analysis components:

### Model Architecture
The strategy is built on a multi-component architecture:

- **Supertrend Indicator**: Utilizes the Supertrend filter with configurable parameters:
  - ATR Period: Customizable length for Average True Range calculation (default: 10)
  - Factor: Sensitivity multiplier for trend detection (default: 3.0)

- **Entry/Exit Conditions**: 
  - Long Entry: When Supertrend direction is positive (1)
  - Short Entry: When Supertrend direction is negative (-1)

### Training and Customization
While this is a rule-based strategy rather than a machine learning model, it offers extensive customization:

#### Strategy Parameters
- **Strategy Toggle**: Enable/disable the entire strategy
- **Supertrend Filter**: Optional Supertrend filter activation
- **Stop Loss**: Configurable stop loss percentage (default: 1.5%)
- **Take Profit**: Configurable take profit percentage (default: 3.0%)

### Implementation Details
- Implemented in Pine Script v5
- Uses percentage-based equity allocation (10% per trade)
- Supports full backtesting on TradingView
- Compatible with multiple timeframes

### Execution
The strategy is directly executable within TradingView's Pine Script editor by copying the `VSVTrend.pine` script.

## Inference / How to Use the Model

The VSVTrend Strategy is designed to be used directly in TradingView as a Pine Script strategy. To use the model for trading:

### Prerequisites
- A TradingView account with Pine Script editor access
- Basic understanding of trading strategies and indicators

### Applying the Strategy

1. Open TradingView and navigate to the Pine Script Editor
2. Copy the entire contents of `VSVTrend.pine`
3. Paste the script into a new Pine Script strategy
4. Apply the strategy to your desired chart

### Configuration Options

The strategy provides several customizable inputs:

- `Strategy ON/OFF`: Toggle the entire strategy on or off
- `Supertrend filter`: Enable or disable the Supertrend filter
- `ATR period`: Adjust the Average True Range period (default: 10)
- `Factor`: Modify the Supertrend calculation factor (default: 3.0)
- `Stop Loss`: Set stop loss percentage (default: 1.5%)
- `Take Profit`: Set take profit percentage (default: 3.0%)

### Typical Workflow

1. Select your trading instrument and timeframe
2. Adjust input parameters as needed
3. Backtest the strategy using TradingView's strategy tester
4. Validate performance before live trading

### Important Notes
- The strategy works on all timeframes
- Recommended to thoroughly backtest before live trading
- Performance may vary based on market conditions and selected parameters

## Project Structure

The project is structured as a single-file Pine Script strategy with a minimal repository layout:

### Main Files
